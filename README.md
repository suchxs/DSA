## Section 1
1. **Abstract Data Type (ADT)**

2. **ADT List**
   - Differentiate a List from an ADT List.
   - List Operations: Initialize, insert, delete, member, locate, and other operations
   - Implementations of ADT List:
     1. **Array Implementation (4 versions)**
        - **Version 1**: List is a structure containing an array and variable count  
          *Note*: count represents the actual number of elements in the array  
          - If MAX is the size of the array, count <= MAX
        - **Version 2**: List is a pointer to a structure containing an array and variable count
        - **Version 3**: List is a structure containing a pointer to the 1st element of a dynamic array, and variable count
        - **Version 4**: List is a pointer to a structure containing a pointer to the 1st element of a dynamic array, and variable count
     2. **Linked List Implementation (Singly Link)**
     3. **Cursor-based Implementation**
   - Time Complexity of the List operations in different implementations: O(1), O(N), and O(N\*N)

3. **ADT Stack and Implementations**
   - What is an ADT Stack?
   - Stack Operations: Top, Pop, Push, and other utility functions such as initStack, isEmpty, and isFull
   - Implementations
     1. **Array Implementation (4 versions)**
     2. **Linked List Implementation**
     3. **Cursor-based Implementation**
   - Time Complexity: O(1) and O(N)

4. **ADT Queue and Implementations**
   - What is an ADT Queue?
   - Queue Operations: Front, Dequeue, Enqueue, and other utility functions such as initQueue, isEmpty, and isFull
   - Implementations
     1. **Linked List Implementation**
        - **Queue is a pointer to a dynamically allocated node**
        - **Queue is a structure containing front and rear pointers to dynamically allocated node/s**
     2. **Circular Array Implementation**
        - **Solution 1**: Add a counter
        - **Solution 2**: Queue is full if there are MAX-1 elements  
          *Note*: where MAX is the size of the array
   - Time Complexity: O(1) and O(N)

**Caution**: The Stack and the Queue **CANNOT be traversed**! (See definition of stack and queue)
